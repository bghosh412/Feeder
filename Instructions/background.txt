This project is about a automatic fish feeder. the code would be deployed to ESP8266, running on 4 Alkaline AA battery. So power usage needs to be extremely frugal.

Overall Hardwares for the project:
1) ESP8266
2) Power: 4 Alkaline AA battery
3) 28BYJ-48 5 volt stepper motor
4) ULN2003 Steeper driver
5) DS3231 RTC timer. For timer to wake-up ESP8266 during feeding time

Software Stack:
UI --> react (non node) location --> /Code/frontend
backend --> micropython location --> /Code/backend
Copilot instructions file is located at /Instructions/instructions.md

The UI needs to be extremely minimal just for settings
post feeding, it should be able to send a notification to the phone via ntfy
